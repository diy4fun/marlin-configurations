# Marlin Configuration for **OctoEnder**
This repository is where I maintain my **OctoEnder**. What is **OctoEnder**? It is 3D printer **Ender-3 PRO** on steroids ;) It is inspired by superior article [OctoEnder alias super-silent printer](https://www.3dpedie.cz/en/inspirations/octoender_by_kiron) and some Reddit Guides. All credits are included in separated commits.

* Based on the most current versions of Marlin (`bugfix-2.0.x`)
* Included helper `./sync` for easy sync with upstream
